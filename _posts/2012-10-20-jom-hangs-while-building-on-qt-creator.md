I encounter a pretty annoy problem this afternoon. The executable jom.exe hangs while I building on Qt Creator. I have tried lots of methods to fix it like cleaning and rebuilding the project. But it still didn't work. I found the solutions on stackoverflow. Upgrading the version of jom.exe can resolve this issue. It has wasted my an hour. This bug is [here](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-6805).
