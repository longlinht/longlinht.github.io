Two months ago, I made a decision for my career: learning machine learning from scratch. Machine learning involves many stuff of math while math is difficult. But I didnot give up in half way this time. Books, Youtube lectures, blogs, I collect learning materials as much as I can and do my best to learning it. 60 days passed, I have had a clarity understanding about some important concepts of Machine learing. In this article, I will figure out these concepts and their relations through 2 figures.

**Figure 1** 

This figure seems simple, but it reveals the relations of some important concepts.
