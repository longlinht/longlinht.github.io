In C++, using `namespace std` can simplify your code by allowing you to omit the `std::` prefix for standard library components. However, this practice is often discouraged for several reasons:

1. **Namespace Pollution**: Bringing all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace increases the risk of name collisions. This can lead to ambiguous references, especially in large projects or when integrating third-party libraries.

2. **Readability**: Explicitly using `std::` makes it clear where a particular function or type is coming from, improving code readability and maintainability. It helps developers and reviewers understand the origin of the symbols used in the code.

3. **Maintainability**: If your project evolves and new identifiers are introduced that conflict with those in the `std` namespace, you may need to refactor significant portions of your code to resolve these conflicts.

### Best Practices

Instead of using `namespace std`, it is better to:
- Use specific using declarations, like `using std::cout;` or `using std::vector;`, to limit the scope of imported names.
- Fully qualify standard library components with `std::`.

By following these practices, you can avoid the potential pitfalls of namespace pollution, maintain clear and readable code, and minimize conflicts in larger or evolving codebases.
