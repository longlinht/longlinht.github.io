I felt overwhelmed reading books about philosophy history every time until I read A Little History of Philosophy, written by Nigel Warburton. Its conciseness and to-the-pointness deeply attracted me, and I finished it fast. Although it only has 40 chapters, it is still not easy to remember and understand all philosophiers'ideas, works, and experiences. So I decided to make a list. Every item on the list includes the philosopher's name, birth and death years, and his or her most famous idea.
