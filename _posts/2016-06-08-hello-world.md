This is my first post for Machine category, I named it 'Hello World' to start my blog. Because many developers start their first program with a single line code to print 'Hello World'. Certainly my first line code also is 'Hello World' in C programming language. I hope this will be a good start!

Before Starting this blog, I think about this expression way for a long time, I didin't know what I should write, I also can't sure I could write down some useful, excellent articles. I even worry about my articles would be some non-value pieces. But now, I never care about it. I will do my best to write some useful, valuable IT articles.

To make a good start, I need figure out what I shoud write. I think about some categories below:

* General IT

* Programming Miscellaneous

* Programming

* Computer Science
