	     <p>This is my first post for Machine category, I named it &#39;Hello World&#39; to start my blog. Because many developers start their first program with a single line code to print &#39;Hello World&#39;. Certainly my first line code also is &#39;Hello World&#39; in C programming language. I hope this will be a good start!</p>

<p>Before Starting this blog, I think about this expression way for a long time, I didin&#39;t know what I should write, I also can&#39;t sure I could write down some useful, excellent articles. I even worry about my articles would be some non-value pieces. But now, I never care about it. I will do my best to write some useful, valuable IT articles.</p>

<p>To make a good start, I need figure out what I shoud write. I think about some categories below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>General IT</p></li>
<li><p>Programming Miscellaneous</p></li>
<li><p>Programming</p></li>
<li><p>Computer Science</p></li>
</ul>
