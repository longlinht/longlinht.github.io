This is my personal website. Since I'm not skilled in front-end technology, I used Jasper's Jekyll template. Thanks to him for the excellent work.

On this blog, I'll share my thoughts on programming and life. If you're puzzled by my post categories, simply interpret "Machine" as computer programming or technology, "Human" as life or reflections on life, and "God" as anything beyond our everyday experiences. I chose these unconventional category names because of a phrase that has inspired me for several years.
